# MapCostImprovement

## Solution Scope & Deliverables

1. Reducing the usage of maps

  * Use machine learning to predict the rider's destination based on past trips, and suggest it as the default destination for the current trip.

  * Implement a smart routing algorithm that reduces the number of map queries required for navigation by finding efficient routes.
  
  * Implement a feature that allows riders to opt for non-map-based navigation options like voice guidance, or even human-based navigation.


2. Hybrid model of using open and premium maps

  * Use premium maps for high-traffic areas and critical navigation features, while using open maps for less important areas and features.
 
  * Develop an algorithm that intelligently switches between open and premium maps based on the rider's location, time of day, and other factors.


3. Crowd-sourced maps

  * Allow riders and drivers to contribute data to create maps for areas where map data is limited or inaccurate.
 
  * Develop a feature that incentivizes users to contribute data, such as offering discounts or rewards.


4. Leveraging the map feature of users or drivers

  * Allow riders to input their own route instead of relying on the app's navigation.
 
  * Allow drivers to input real-time traffic and road condition data to improve the app's routing.


5. Disruptive innovations to replace maps in some use cases

  * Develop a technology that uses sensors or other data to navigate without relying on maps, such as using GPS coordinates or landmarks.

  * Use augmented reality to provide navigation guidance without relying on traditional maps.
  
  
 
Reducing map costs is a critical challenge for Namma Yatri. By exploring a hybrid model of using open and premium maps, leveraging crowd-sourced and user-generated maps, and exploring disruptive innovations, Namma Yatri can reduce the cost of using maps, while providing a seamless and accurate navigation experience to its users.
